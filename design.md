# Overview
> At least two paragraphs that describe the purpose, goal, context, and intended users for the project.

# Background and Related 
> A description and discussion of similar projects, methods, experiments, or other things that are related to your project. Most frequently, this section contains information about related approaches, or systems that offer similar functionality or use similar methods. Sometimes it also addresses the history of the project and its context, especially if it is part of a larger effort. You can also include a discussion of methods, techniques, technologies, tools, or similar aspects if they are essential for the project. 

# Difficulty
> Relative degree of difficulty for the project, considering the context. I may change this during the course of the quarter, typically to reflect changes in the scope or focus of the project. Usually, this is in the range of 8-10, assuming that the team has discussed their topic choice with me. 

# Relevance
> Assessment of how well the focus of the project matches with the class topics
